Any good System Design question should reveal a lot about a candidate’s understanding of architecture and inner workings of large-scale systems. The question should be complex enough to engage the candidate and allow them to demonstrate their skill for building web-scale services, but not so complicated that the interviewee feels overwhelmed.

When I interviewed SWE candidates at Facebook and Microsoft, I wasn’t just looking for strong coding skills and soft skills that demonstrated alignment with company values. I was also looking for a candidate who could design a software system that met requirements, explain the system’s architecture and tradeoffs, and dive deep into an area of specialization like API design or a recommendation engine.
