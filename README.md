Ever wondered how Spotify predicts a new playlist to a user based on the users current playlist or how YouTube predicts the following video users might want to watch next. Is this magic?

This happens because of machine learning-based recommendation systems. The recommendation system is a machine learning-based model that helps users discover new products or services based on users’ past preferences.

The recommender system has become an essential element in the digital world, where users may confuse themselves due to an abundance of data. Thus, this feature can help users pick a product or service that perfectly fits their preference.

What is a Recommendation System?
A Recommendation System aims to predict the user’s choices and recommend the product or service that is likely to be interesting.

These systems can do so because of user data. The function of a Recommendation System mainly depends on two kinds of information:

Characteristic information: Information that defines the profile of a product (tag, category, etc.) or a user (preferences, profile, etc.).
User-item interactions: Information that defines user-item relationship (rating, like/dislike, etc.).
Based on this, we can categorize two broad classes of the algorithm used in a Recommendation System.
